<h1>Project Idea</h1>
<p1>
 I want to create an app where you can split shipping costs between multiple people for online orders. I live in a remote town and because we live so far away from any capital city, freight can be very expensive. When people are buying furniture online or other bulky items we can get charged into the hundreds for shipping costs. This app will connect you with orders looking to place orders from the same place as you. 
<br>
There are a few facebook groups for example “Ikea orders” in the town, people join the group and someone will post in there “im placing an order tomorrow if anyone wants anything”. They will then collect everyones items, place the order themselves and then split the shipping costs between everyone and collect the funds. I think this app will help connect you with people that are looking to place orders from the same locations as you. This will save having to join multiple facebook pages and can help keep track of the shipping costs people owe and organise your orders into group chats. 
<br>
You will make an account, put in your profile details such as name, location and contact details. In the app you will need to disclose your location to find people in your area that are also looking at placing orders. So for example, “Tom Price, W.A”. 
Then you will go to another section on the app and select what stores you are looking at buying from. For example,  I need a new outdoor setting and a barbecue so I will be looking at buying from Fantastic Furniture and Barbecues Galore. Simply tick the stores and click next. 
The app will then search for people in your location that are also looking at buying from the same stores that you selected and connect you with them. You can then send them a message through the app and discuss details of ordering. You can choose the option of making group chats or messaging individually. The messaging part of the app will let you send files and images so you can send one person what you want to order and they can place the order or visa versa.

Tools required:
-	A computer/laptop with a good internet connection
-	Android Studio, this allows you to develop apps for android
-	An android phone to test the app
<br>
Skills required:
-	Knowledge in writing Java. Java is a programming language most commonly used for creating Android apps. 
-	Knowledge in how to use Android Studio. Android studio is an integrated development environment (IDE). An IDE is a software application that provides the tools for programmers to develop software.

The outcome im hoping for this project is to make life easier when ordering online in remote and rural towns. Freight and shipping costs are always an issue when living far away from any major cities, sharing the costs is the perfect solution because it makes it more affordable, boosts product sales for companies and allows customers to purchase the products they want. Im hoping this app will eliminate the need to join several facebook groups and connect people looking to buy from the same suppliers. It can bring communities together and make it a lot easier to communicate on ordering and sharing freight costs.
