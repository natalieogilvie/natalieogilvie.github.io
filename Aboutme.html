<h1>About me</h1>

<p>I live in a remote mining town 16 hours drive North of Perth, W.A Currently working as a haul truck driver. My interest starting in I.T at around the age of 14, my parents bought me my first laptop and I would spend hours on MySpace creating and writing HTML for my page. After highschool I worked as an administrator for 4 years and would always find myself doing jobs for the i.t department, whether it be setting up printers or emails.  I love all things about technology but my main interests revolve around I.T support and web design. I love helping people with their technology, especially in a business environment. Whether it is setting up printers in an office to helping them with their social media accounts. I would love a career in helping build and design websites as well as ongoing i.t support.
Because I live remote and work full time, online study was the best option for me. RMIT worked best because it allowed me to enrol into subjects before committing to the full degree. RMIT also lets me use the first 2 subjects as an entry pathway into the degree. 
After my studies Iâ€™m hoping to be able to have the knowledge and skills to be able to go out into the I.T industry and know enough to have a successful career but also have the tools to continue learning. I want to be confident in being able to support and work in a team whilst bringing my own knowledge to the table.
