<h1>About me</h1>

<p>I live in a remote mining town 16 hours drive North of Perth, W.A Currently working as a haul truck driver. My interest started in I.T at around the age of 14, my parents bought me my first laptop and I would spend hours on MySpace creating and writing HTML for my page. After highschool I worked as an administrator for a food wholesaler/distributor for 4 years. I would always find myself doing jobs for the I.T department, whether it be setting up printers or emails. I found the programs that the company used to process all their orders so frustrating, it was ill fitted for the size of the company and way too slow. I made it my personal mission to seek out something better suited to the company and after a few years the change was made to a modern, fast and dynamic software that suited the requirements of the company. 
I love all things about technology but my main interests revolve around I.T support and web/software design. I love helping people with their technology and giving advice on what programs to use, how their websites should look, how their businesses can be more user friendly and how to make the most of their social media accounts. I feel that combining my experience with customers and my love for I.T I would thrive in a career with helping build and design websites, business software, be a business analyst, as well as providing that ongoing I.T support for businesses. 
Because I live remote and work full time, online study was the best option for me. RMIT worked best because it allowed me to enrol into subjects before committing to the full degree. RMIT also lets me use the first 2 subjects as an entry pathway into the degree. 
After my studies I’m hoping to be able to have the knowledge and skills to be able to go out into the I.T industry and know enough to have a successful career but also have the tools to continue learning. I want to be confident in being able to support and work in a team whilst bringing my own knowledge to the table.

  <h1>Personal Profile</h1>
  <br>
  <p>
    I have completed the following online tests:
Learning style test, which says I am an auditory learner.
    <br>
Personality test, which says my personality type is “The Logician”.
    <br>
Creative problem-solving test. 
    <br>
An auditory learner learns from hearing. I can take in information with just listening to it and I benefit from being told instructions, rather than shown or to read them. My personality type as a logician means I am good at analysing, an abstract thinker, imaginative and open minded. My creative problem-solving test says I am “not afraid to let me imagination run wild when problem solving”. 
Being an auditory learner helps me study online because I like to watch tutorials on YouTube and at the same time run through it in another screen, so I don’t have to be watching the video. It also helps me in our group discussions take in information. I feel having the personality “The Logician” benefits an I.T career because you need to be logical and be able to solve problems, but at the same time bring your creativity and imagination to your work. I.T is an always changing environment, so being really creative when problem-solving can help keep up with changing trends in the industry. 
    <br>
I feel these results indicate I am quite creative and imaginative and I feel that benefits a team by thinking outside of the box. The personality test indicated I am 97% introverted, which might indicate I would take the backseat in a team and not be the leader. Having said that, I think it can also mean that I will handle being delegated jobs and tasks to do. When forming a team, I think it will be important to note everyone else’s learning styles as well as your own. Some people may need to be more visual when working in the group, therefore video chat might work better for them. Some may need things written down and need to take notes while auditory learners like me might benefit from an audio chat.
