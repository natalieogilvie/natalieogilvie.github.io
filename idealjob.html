  <br>
This position is for a Web designer. I would be liaising with clients, drawing up design ideas, presenting designs to clients and making sure they are happy with the website ideas. This position is appealing to me because not only is it website design, but you also get to work closely with your clients. This would be a very rewarding job, being able to use your skills in creating your client’s ideal website. Experience required Is to have a bachelors degree or two to three years in relevant fields. 
I currently have over 4 years’ experience in customer service, basic I.T skills and very basic HTML skills. To get more relevant experience for this job and for web design I plan on finishing my bachelors in I.T with a minor in internet design. There are also a lot of free online recourses that encourage learning with website code.
