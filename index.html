<h1>About me</h1>

<p>I live in a remote mining town 16 hours drive North of Perth, W.A called Tom Price.  Currently working as a haul truck driver. What some people find interesting about me is im actually a dog groomer by trade, dogs are a massive part of my life and I am a dog mum of 3, and always wanting more!
  <br>
  My interest started in I.T at around the age of 14, my parents bought me my first laptop and I would spend hours on MySpace creating and writing HTML for my page. After highschool I worked as an administrator for a food wholesaler/distributor for 4 years. I would always find myself doing jobs for the I.T department, whether it be setting up printers or emails. I found the programs that the company used to process all their orders so frustrating, it was ill fitted for the size of the company and way too slow. I made it my personal mission to seek out something better suited to the company and after a few years the change was made to a modern, fast and dynamic software that suited the requirements of the company. 
I love all things about technology but my main interests revolve around I.T support and web/software design. I love helping people with their technology and giving advice on what programs to use, how their websites should look, how their businesses can be more user friendly and how to make the most of their social media accounts. I feel that combining my experience with customers and my love for I.T I would thrive in a career with helping build and design websites, business software, be a business analyst, as well as providing that ongoing I.T support for businesses. 
Because I live remote and work full time, online study was the best option for me. RMIT worked best because it allowed me to enrol into subjects before committing to the full degree. RMIT also lets me use the first 2 subjects as an entry pathway into the degree. 
After my studies Iâ€™m hoping to be able to have the knowledge and skills to be able to go out into the I.T industry and know enough to have a successful career but also have the tools to continue learning. I want to be confident in being able to support and work in a team whilst bringing my own knowledge to the table.
